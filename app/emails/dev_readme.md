## How to create email

Use checkEmail example and every time send request to send email because preview in react-email works not properly
and you may got different email from that you saw in react-email preview

I reccomend you to do it with `<table>` `<tbody>` `<tr>` `<td>` rather then with `<div>`

You may check examples to get understanding how it works - https://react.email/examples

Also I want add that breackpoints in emails doesn't work that's why you need create it for mobile view
